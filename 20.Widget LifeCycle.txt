                    20.Widget LifeCycle

StatelessWidget
    --> state does not change over time.
    --> build function only runs once

stateful
    --> state can change over time
    --> setState() triggers the build function

In stateful widget:

    initState():
     --> called only once when the widget is created.
     -->Subscribe to the stream or any object thet could change our data.

     Build() :
        --> builds the sidget tree
        --> A build is triggered every time we use setState()

    Dispose() :
        --> when the widget/state is removed.
