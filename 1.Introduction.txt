What is Flutter?
    --> Mobile UI framework for creating native apps for IOs and android
    --> Sigle code-base mean we only have to write our app once for multiple devices.

--> Every thing in flutter is widget
--> widget has different properties

Install flutter SDk, android studio and android emulator.

And create the first flutter app and the proj name is my_app

Folder Structure
    -->(F) my_app //proj Folder
    |        |
    |        |
    |        -->(F) Android //this for android
    |        |
    |        |
    |        -->(F) iOS //this is for iOS
    |        |
    |        |
    |        -->(F)lib //99% we work in this folder
    |        |    |
    |        |    |
    |        |    -->(f) main.dart // this is the place where our source code goes.
    |        -->(F)test // for testing the code
    -->(F) External libraries

    In main.dart
        import "packages:flutter/material.dart"

        void main() => runApp(materialApp({
            home : Text('Hello Ninjas'),
        }));

        runApp() // runs the widget
        //materialApp() is the material widget like container
