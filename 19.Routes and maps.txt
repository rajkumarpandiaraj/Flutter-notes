                        19.Routes and Maps/Obj.txt

To define Routes in flutter use routes property in materialApp which takes maps/obj as its value which consist of routes

syntax :
    routes : {
        'path' : (context) => widget()
    }

path key takes function as its value with context as argand returns Widget
 context holds the information of the routes.

In main.dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:world_time_app/pages/home.dart';
import 'package:world_time_app/pages/loading.dart';
import 'package:world_time_app/pages/choose_location.dart';

void main() => runApp(MaterialApp(

    initialRoute: '/home', //for developing purpose initialRoute should be '/home'
    routes: {
      '/': (context) => Loading(), //after finished the app first we have show the loading page
      '/home': (context) => Home(), //and then home page.
      '/location': (context) => Location(),
    }
));

while loading the location page in Home page, location page load above the Home page.
